# My First Java Programs ðŸŽ‰

Hello! This is my second collection of Java programs. I'm learning Java step by step, starting with the basics and control statements.

These projects helped me practice:
- Printing to the console
- Taking user input
- Using `if-else`, `switch-case`, and logic
- Solving small programming problems

All code is written in **Java** and runs on any computer with Java installed.

### ðŸ”¹ Control Statements
Programs that use decision-making (`if`, `else`, `switch`).

1. **EvenOrOdd.java**  
   Checks if a number is even or odd.

2. **LargestOfThreeIfElse.java**  
   Uses `if-else` to find the biggest number.

3. **LeapYear.java**  
   Checks if a year is a leap year.

4. **CalculatorSwitch.java**  
   A simple calculator using `switch-case`.

5. **VowelOrConsonant.java**  
   Checks if a letter is a vowel or consonant.
